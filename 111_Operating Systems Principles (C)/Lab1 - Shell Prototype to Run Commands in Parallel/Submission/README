================================ || PART 1A || ================================

  In the "read-command.c" source file, I included a header file "my_stack.h",
which contains my declaration variables and functions for a stack using a
linked list and the definitions included in "read-command.c". I used the stack
struct for 2 different stacks to make the command stream: an operator stack
and a command stack. I used the link that someone posted on Piazza,
<https://www.cs.bu.edu/teaching/c/stack/linked-list/> for a refresher on how
to implement a linked list.

  For the "make_command_stream" function, I read the following source:
<http://www.newty.de/fpt/fpt.html> to get a better understanding of function
pointers, since I have only seen examples of them before, but never worked with
them myself.
